# Hand-Controller
Use your webcam to control games that use WASD

By the way, I made this like 10 months ago, so don't mind some bad code. It was adapted from a hand tracker, I can't be bothered to find the original article or video.
just run the script, and it will use your webcam as a tracker. Simply hover your hands over your webcam.

dependecies: mediapip, pydirectinput, opencv-python
